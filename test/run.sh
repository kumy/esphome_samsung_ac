# This runs the SamsungAc test suite. The setup for this is currently
# located on the private server (aws-wbr) esphome/ dir. The important parts of that will
# eventually be included in the test/ dir here.
#
# See below for issues running unit tests natively on linux.
#
# To use the above mentioned setup, enter its esphome/ dir, and run the following command:
#   docker/compose.sh run -w /SamsungAc esphome /bash_session.sh
#
# That will launch a Docker container from esphome/esphome image into the /SamsungAc dir.
# Then run the following command to run this script:
#   test/run.sh
# 
# Note: You will have to install build-essential to get this to work,
# but you will first need to make room on the aws-wbr root drive.
#
# Platformio 'native' testing uses the native gcc install (build-essential on debian).
# Platformio 'native' testing can't use any of the framework specific libraries,
# like Arduino or ESPHome, since they don't have compatible code for desktop systems.
# However, there IS a mock Arduino libaray called 'ArduinoFake' that will provide
# Arduino.h for testing purposes on native desktop systems.
# I don't know if anything exists for ESPHome.

###  The test is currently failing, even though we've isolated it to just C++ libraries,
###  the ArduinoFake library, and the Preferences library (no esphome libraries).
###
###  2025-01021: OK, I've tried testing with no dynamic_cron code or libs loaded, only
###    Croncpp
###    Preferences
###    ArduinoFake
###    unity
###
###  And it turns out Preferences library wont compile (I think cuz it tries to acces file system library for NVS on esp32).
###  So if we still want to run unit tests natively (on linux), we're gonna have to move all the Preferences code
###  out of the new core.h file. Doing that, we'll not be testing a large and complex portion of our library.
###  So... do we give up on native platform unit testing, and just test the old monolithic dynamic_cron.h file on
###  the esp32? Or should we mock all esp-dependent and any hardware-dependent classes and functions, so we
###  can test on the native host (linux)?

# pio test --without-uploading -e esp32 -c test/platformio.ini
#pio test --without-uploading -e native -c test/platformio.ini ${@}
pio test --without-uploading -c test/platformio.ini ${@--e native}
# You can add --without-testing when you run this for 'esphome',
# if you want to suppress the error about not finding the serial port.
# It will still build the firmware.

# To clean out the build cache run:
#   pio run --target clean -e native -c test/platformio.ini
